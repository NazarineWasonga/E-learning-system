            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>E-learning, also referred to as online learning or electronic learning, is the acquisition of knowledge which
                takes place through electronic technologies and media. In simple language, e-learning is defined as “learning
                that is enabled electronically”. Typically, e-learning is conducted on the Internet, where students can access
                their learning materials online at any place and time. E-Learning most often takes place in the form of online
                courses, online degrees, or online programs.
